Team challenge entry of 
AmaanGodhrawala and j-pohl for the challenge below:

"For this round, we will be looking at components and APIs. You may use a framework like React or Svelte if your team decides.  However, this is not required, as you can still generate components in Vanilla JavaScript.  A framework may be a bit tricky to separate roles, as often files will have multiple languages mixed together-- but I trust you all to make good decisions and stick to your roles.

This challenge is called "Deck of Cards" - you will be building a website that shows a series of cards from data retrieved from an API.

For example, you could build a Pokedex from the data at https://pokeapi.co/. Or use data from NASA at https://api.nasa.gov/.  Or select an interesting API from this list: https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis.  The possibilities are endless!

Looking forward to seeing the results!  Best of luck and remember that help is always available!"
